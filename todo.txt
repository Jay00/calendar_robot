Tests:
- I got lazy with the testing, I need to write better tests
- Need to write better tests, specifically for the text_processor_class


Finish the Text Processor Class
- I started to upgrade the text processor class and squash bugs, I haven't finished


Add Database:
- Have hearing objects save themselves to a data base
- Eventually we can you the website to provide analytics on the saved data
- Create script to go through prior save calendars and save all the data to the database


Replace the Run System:
- Currently the script is set up to run as a Cronjob every 5 minutes, but there may be a better way
- Calendars are generally update around 7:00 pm each night.  If the system has just downloaded the calendar,
  there really isn't a need to check again until the next afternoon.

  Current Cron Job:

  Crontab
  */5 * * * *  python3  /home/jason/calendar_robot/main.py


Move To Docker:
- Replace the current virtual environment with a Dockerfile
- Make the Database run in a separate container and create the appropriate Docker-Compose file


Create A Website:
- Create a website that allows attorneys to sign up and receive daily alerts
- Create a billing system to charge a monthly fee
- Allow attorney to perform searches and analytics for an additional fee
- Allow Case Tracking Services, allow someone to sign up and receive alerts on a specific case
- Track disappearing cases
